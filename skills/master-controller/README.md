# Master Controller

Master Controller (MC) supervises execution of an already-approved implementation plan. It is not a planner and it is not an implementer. It runs one frozen slice at a time through an AI coding harness, records durable artifacts, and verifies gates from outside the harness session. When verification finds a fixable gap, MC runs a bounded self-correcting repair loop: it surfaces the specific violation back into the live orchestrator session (preserving the context the orchestrator already built), lets it fix the gap, and re-verifies with the complete, unrelaxed gate. Only integrity breaches, an exhausted repair budget, a tripped same-signature circuit breaker, or policy-required approvals stop the run for a human.

The three roles: **MC** is the deterministic supervisor — it owns run state and gates, steers repairs, never writes slice code, and never delegates to a worker itself. The **orchestrator** is the harness in tmux executing one slice (scoped-implementation → validation → drift-audit → code-review → commit); it reports a structured result but holds no final authority. A **worker** is a bounded helper the orchestrator launches via `ai-orchestrator`'s `worker_jobs.py`; it owns no gates, never commits, and never re-delegates.

MC has two documented operating styles. Model-supervised MC keeps the MC model in the loop for live operational judgment while deterministic commands own state transitions and gates. Deterministic batch MC runs the existing fail-closed `run-next` and `run --scope remaining` paths for simple unattended execution. The current implementation provides contract docs, durable run state, conservative plan discovery, tmux-backed slice execution, model-supervised observe/send/start/wait/pause/finalize/stop primitives, structured result capture, fail-closed gate verification, looping over remaining slices, cancellation, and summaries.

## What MC Owns

- Creating `.ai-mc/runs/<timestamp>/run.json` under the target repo.
- Updating `.ai-mc/current` to the active run.
- Recording repo, branch, harness, plan, environment preflight, and policy.
- Parsing implementation-plan markdown conservatively enough to identify frozen slice contracts.
- Refusing incomplete, ambiguous, approval-gated, or unauthorized slices.
- Reporting the next eligible slice in `run-next --dry-run`.
- Running one eligible slice with `run-next`.
- Running eligible slices sequentially with `run --scope remaining`.
- Capturing prompt, pane output, git status, git diff, validation, drift audit, code review, and `orchestrator-result.json` artifacts.
- Recording supervision state and append-only operational event logs for model-supervised runs.
- Verifying orchestrator claims against git evidence, classifying every non-pass gate outcome with a stable failure signature as repairable or terminal.
- Driving the bounded repair loop: archiving the stale result, steering the live session with a targeted correction (or relaunching a fresh session per the circuit breaker), re-verifying with unrelaxed gates, and enforcing the repair budget from persisted state.
- Stopping for a human on integrity breaches (HEAD not advanced or not descended from the slice start, wrong slice reported), exhausted repair budget, a tripped circuit breaker, or approval-gated slices.

## What MC Does Not Own

- Creating or repairing implementation plans.
- Docker or container setup.
- Semantic code review inside MC.
- Dependency, license, remote push, PR, release, or deployment actions.
- Bypassing human approval for approval-gated work.
- Inferring authorization when plan sections are missing.
- Accepting a slice from screen text, transcript claims, or operational hints without deterministic gate evidence.

## CLI

Initialize a run:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py init \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --plan /path/to/plan.md \
  --harness codex
```

Initialize on an explicitly authorized branch, creating it when missing:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py init \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --plan /path/to/plan.md \
  --harness codex \
  --branch mc-trial/pi-calculator \
  --create-branch
```

Initialize while adopting slices the operator attests were already completed and committed under a previous run (for example after a plan revision forced a fresh init), and/or with an explicit repair budget:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py init \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --plan /path/to/plan.md \
  --harness codex \
  --assume-complete "Slice 1,Slice 2" \
  --max-repair-attempts 3
```

Record operator approval for an approval-gated slice so the run can proceed without editing the frozen plan:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py approve \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --slice "Slice 3" \
  --reason "risk reviewed with operator"
```

Check state (`status` also warns when an active run's tmux session has vanished — the signature of a controlling command killed mid-run):

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py status --repo /path/to/repo
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py summarize --repo /path/to/repo
```

List harness and worker capability profiles:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py profiles
```

Preflight the next slice before starting a tmux harness:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py preflight \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --worker-tools copilot \
  --allow-profile-command
```

Preview the next runnable slice:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py run-next --repo /path/to/repo --dry-run
```

Run the next eligible slice:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py run-next \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --worker-tools copilot \
  --allow-profile-command
```

Run with explicit orchestrator and worker model/effort requests:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py run-next \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --harness-model <model> \
  --harness-effort <effort> \
  --worker-tools codex \
  --worker-model <model> \
  --worker-effort <effort> \
  --allow-profile-command
```

Run eligible slices until all are complete or a stop condition is reached:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py run \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --scope remaining \
  --worker-tools copilot \
  --allow-profile-command
```

Start the next eligible slice in model-supervised mode and return immediately:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py start-slice \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --worker-tools copilot \
  --allow-profile-command
```

Observe or wait on the active model-supervised slice without finalizing gates:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py observe --repo /path/to/repo
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py wait --repo /path/to/repo --seconds 120 --poll-seconds 2
```

Send a short literal instruction to the active slice session:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py send \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --text "You were interrupted. Review what you were doing then continue." \
  --reason "resume after rolling usage reset"
```

Pause until an explicit timestamp with timezone, then return control for re-observation:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py pause-until \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --until 2026-07-05T18:30:00+10:00 \
  --buffer-seconds 180 \
  --reason "rolling usage reset"
```

Finalize or stop the active model-supervised slice:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py finalize-slice --repo /path/to/repo
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py stop-with-evidence \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --reason "weekly usage cap shown on screen"
```

Cancel a run and record the reason:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py stop --repo /path/to/repo --reason "manual stop"
```

Archive sensitive worker state from a completed or stopped run:

```bash
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py archive-sensitive --repo /path/to/repo --dry-run
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py archive-sensitive --repo /path/to/repo
```

`run-next --dry-run` exits successfully only when the next uncompleted slice has the required sections, has a non-empty authorized file surface, and is not approval-gated. Runtime execution also requires a clean target worktree outside `.ai-mc/`.

## Internal Layout

`scripts/mc.py` is intentionally a thin, stable executable wrapper. The implementation lives in `scripts/mc_lib/`, grouped by responsibility: CLI construction, command handlers, plan parsing, run state, git/process helpers, harness profiles, tmux control, runtime artifacts, and gate verification. Keep public CLI behavior, run-state JSON, artifact names, and environment variables stable when editing these modules.

## Default MC Execution Flow

`SKILL.md` is the source of truth for the default operating path (this README previously duplicated it and the two copies drifted). In short: choose **model-supervised MC** when live operational handling matters (usage/session limits, transient interruptions) and **deterministic batch MC** when a conservative fail-closed run is enough; follow the step sequences in `SKILL.md` → "Default Operating Path". Do not ask users to hand-compose harness sandbox, model, or effort flags — use `profiles`, `preflight`, `--worker-tools`, `--harness-model`, `--harness-effort`, `--worker-model`, `--worker-effort`, and `--allow-profile-command`.

Two operational rules worth repeating here because they bite in practice (details in `SKILL.md` → "Long-Running Command Discipline"):

- MC's blocking commands outlive assistant tool-call limits. Run `run`/`run-next` in the background and poll `status`; in model-supervised mode use repeated bounded `wait` calls, not one long wait.
- For model-supervised runs on subscription harnesses, put the MC model on a different provider than the orchestrator harness so one usage window cannot stall both.

`observe` and `wait` expose `operational_hints` in their JSON output. These hints summarize common pane/transcript evidence such as rolling usage limits, weekly/monthly/account limits, service unavailable messages, network transients, auth/trust/permission prompts, external side-effect requests, idle/no-progress, result-ready, and process-exited-without-result. Ordinary hints are evidence for the MC model, not commands. Hard-stop hints are deterministic guards: `send`, `pause-until`, and wait/retry/resume paths refuse unattended continuation when weekly, monthly, account, billing, unknown-limit, auth, trust, permission, or external-side-effect evidence is present.

Reset parsing is intentionally narrow. Relative durations such as `try again in 3 hours` are preferred. Absolute local reset times are accepted only when they are unambiguously near-future in the controller timezone or include an explicit timezone; otherwise MC reports an unknown-limit hard stop for human judgment.

## Profiles and Launch Requirements

MC stores one profile per tool instead of one profile per possible role combination. Tool profiles describe mechanical readiness, not suitability: Codex, Claude, Copilot, and OpenCode are all mechanically validated to run unattended in tmux (accept prompt injection, expose a ready state, fail closed on trust prompts) and are listed as orchestrator-capable in `HARNESS_PROFILES`. Which harness and role actually fits a given task is a per-run operator/model decision based on the configured model's demonstrated capability — see `references/harness-adapter-contract.md` for the validation evidence and residual coverage gaps, and `ai-orchestrator`'s `SKILL.md` for the functional role definitions.

At runtime, MC composes the launch command from the selected harness plus explicit requirements:

- `--worker-tools copilot` tells MC the slice will use a Copilot worker and the harness needs worker-compatible setup.
- `--allow-profile-command` tells MC to use the tested profile command instead of requiring a hand-written `--harness-command`.
- `--harness-model` and `--harness-effort` are composed by MC only when the selected orchestrator profile supports them.
- `--worker-model` and `--worker-effort` are rendered into the slice prompt with per-tool command guidance; the orchestrator must preserve worker evidence and stop if the selected worker cannot honor them.
- `commit_required=true` in run policy tells the Codex profile to add scoped git-directory access for local commits.

This avoids a large matrix of incomplete names such as `codex-copilot-commit`. The role information stays with each tool profile, and the slice requirements are visible on the command line.

## Run State

State is stored under the target repository:

```text
.ai-mc/
  current -> runs/<timestamp>
  runs/
    <timestamp>/
      run.json
      operational-events.jsonl
      slices/
        slice-001/
          prompt.md
          activity-attempt-1.jsonl
          pane-capture.txt
          pane-capture-live-latest.txt
          worker-runs/
          tmp/
          tool-homes/
          copilot-home/
          git-status-before.txt
          git-status-after.txt
          git-diff.patch
          validation-summary.md
          drift-audit.md
          code-review.md
          worker-evidence.md
          orchestrator-result.json
```

MC does not edit the project's own `.gitignore`. Instead, `init` writes a self-ignoring `.ai-mc/.gitignore` containing `*`, so the audit directory — including seeded worker credentials and full transcripts — is never staged by a stray `git add -A`. MC's own dirty-tree and changed-file checks already exclude `.ai-mc/`.

Each `activity-attempt-<n>.jsonl` line records `checked_at`, `running`, and `active` fields from the tmux pane activity check. `pane-capture-live-latest.txt` preserves the last live pane text seen during polling, which is useful when the final pane capture is unavailable after a fast harness exit. Batch polling also records `observation` operational events to `operational-events.jsonl` (on state change, with a 60-second floor while nothing changes) and refreshes `observation-latest.json` — the same evidence the model-supervised `observe`/`wait` primitives produce.

`run.json` includes a `supervision` object with default pause/retry policy, pause budgets, and the default continuation prompt. Existing runs that do not have this object load with backwards-compatible defaults. High-frequency model-supervised observations and actions belong in `operational-events.jsonl`, an append-only log, rather than repeated `run.json` rewrites.

While a slice is running, `current_slice` records the slice id, title, artifact directory, tmux session, attempt, start time, `before_head`, a `repair` object ({round, last_signature, signature_streak, session_generation} — the persisted repair-loop and circuit-breaker state), an optional `orchestrator_session_id` for transcript lookup, and an optional `pause` object. Persisting `before_head` is required for model-supervised finalization because changed-file verification must compare against the real slice start, not guess `HEAD^`; it stays fixed across repair rounds and relaunches so verification remains cumulative. Repair rounds add per-round artifacts (`orchestrator-result-repair-<n>.json`, `repair-prompt-repair-<n>.md`, `pane-capture-repair-<n>.txt`, `git-status-repair-<n>.txt`) beside the standard slice artifacts. See `references/run-state-schema.md` for the full semantics.

Worker state and temporary files should stay under the slice artifact directory. MC exports fixed paths for worker runs, temporary files, and tool-specific home directories so orchestrators do not have to invent locations.

## Plan Eligibility

MC expects implementation-plan slice sections with these headings:

- `### Intended Change`
- `### Acceptance Criteria`
- `### Authorized Surface`
- `### Explicit Non-Goals`
- `### Risk Flags`
- `### Validation Plan`
- `### Rollback Path`

The parser fails closed when a required section is missing, when no files are listed under `Files allowed to change`, or when `Approval needed before implementation` is anything other than an exact `no` (a prefix like "not yet decided" or "none" is treated as unresolved, not as "no", and stops the run).

An explicit `yes` approval flag can be cleared at runtime with `approve --slice "<Slice N>" --reason "<why>"`, which records the operator's approval in run state and the operational event log — the plan file itself stays frozen. A missing or unclear flag cannot be approved away; that is a planning defect to fix in the plan (which then requires a fresh `init`, using `--assume-complete` to adopt slices already completed under the previous run).

Authorized file entries are matched with segment-aware globbing: a plain path matches exactly, a trailing `/` matches everything under a directory, and a `*`/`?` glob matches within a single path segment (so `*.md` authorizes only top-level markdown). Use `**` explicitly for a recursive match such as `docs/**/*.md`.

The plan is frozen at `init` by content digest. If the plan file changes mid-run, MC stops before the next slice; a revised plan requires a fresh `init`. Duplicate `## Slice N:` numbers are rejected at `init`, and each runtime slice re-checks that the current branch still matches the branch captured at `init`. `init --branch <name>` records and switches to an intended branch before the run; `--create-branch` creates it only when explicitly requested and only from a clean worktree.

## Model-Supervised State Contract

The model-supervised transition adds these durable concepts without changing deterministic gate acceptance:

- `supervision.mode`: defaults to `deterministic-batch`; `start-slice` sets it to `model-supervised`, and the batch driver re-asserts `deterministic-batch` at each slice start.
- `supervision.pause_policy`: names recoverable rolling-window and transient-service handling while preserving hard stops for weekly/account/unknown events.
- `supervision.pause_counters`: tracks consecutive pauses for the current slice and cumulative paused seconds for the run.
- `operational_events_path`: points at the append-only JSONL event log for observations, sends, waits, pauses, resumes, and stops.
- `current_slice.before_head`: records the commit at slice start for out-of-process finalization.
- `current_slice.orchestrator_session_id`: records the launched Claude session id when MC composed one for transcript capture.
- `current_slice.pause`: records `paused_until`, `reason`, and an evidence event id when a bounded pause is active.
- `operational_hints`: appears in observation JSON with `kind`, optional `subtype`, confidence, reset/retry fields when parseable, `hard_stop`, evidence excerpt, source, detection time, and recovery guidance.

The model-supervised primitives are `observe`, `send`, `wait`, `pause-until`, `start-slice`, `finalize-slice`, and `stop-with-evidence`. They must not accept work by interpreting natural-language output; they only provide operational control and evidence capture before deterministic gates run.

## Safe Local Trial

Use a temporary git repo and a small plan before supervising real work. The local harness below writes the same structured artifacts expected from an AI orchestrator, commits only the authorized file, and then waits long enough for MC to capture the tmux pane:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
git -C "$tmp" init
git -C "$tmp" config user.email mc-test@example.invalid
git -C "$tmp" config user.name "MC Test"
cat > "$tmp/plan.md" <<'PLAN'

This trial creates only `.ai-mc/` state and the authorized toy commit inside the temporary repo. The `--harness-command` override is for controlled local validation; normal runs use the command named by `--harness`.

To trial model-supervised usage-limit handling, reuse the same temporary repo setup and plan, then replace the harness with one that waits for the continuation prompt before writing a result:

python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py finalize-slice --repo "$tmp"
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py summarize --repo "$tmp"
```

The first `wait` should show a non-hard-stop rolling-window usage hint with recovery guidance to pause and send a continuation prompt. `pause-until` records the bounded pause, `send` delivers only the continuation text to the current slice session, and `finalize-slice` still requires the normal validation, drift-audit, code-review, commit, and clean-worktree evidence before accepting the slice.

To trial the exited-process usage-limit path, use a fresh temporary repo from the setup above and a harness that exits before creating `orchestrator-result.json`:

```bash
cat > "$tmp/usage_limit_exit_harness.py" <<'PY'
import time

time.sleep(2.5)
print("\033[2J\033[HUsage limit reached. Try again in 1 minute.", flush=True)
time.sleep(1)
PY
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py init --repo "$tmp" --plan "$tmp/plan.md" --harness codex
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py start-slice --repo "$tmp" --harness-command "python3 $tmp/usage_limit_exit_harness.py"
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py wait --repo "$tmp" --seconds 3 --poll-seconds 0.1
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py wait --repo "$tmp" --seconds 5 --poll-seconds 0.1
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py finalize-slice --repo "$tmp"
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py summarize --repo "$tmp"
```

The first `wait` should preserve the rolling-limit pane evidence while the harness is still alive. The second `wait` should return after the process exits without a structured result, and MC must not send a continuation prompt into the old session. `finalize-slice` should block because `orchestrator-result.json` is missing, so the MC model should restart only from a clean authorized state or stop for the user.

For a minimal fast-exit variant that may close before tmux can preserve the final pane text, use:

```bash
cat > "$tmp/usage_limit_exit_fast_harness.py" <<'PY'
import time

print("Usage limit reached. Try again in 1 minute.", flush=True)
time.sleep(0.2)
PY
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py init --repo "$tmp" --plan "$tmp/plan.md" --harness codex
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py start-slice --repo "$tmp" --harness-command "python3 $tmp/usage_limit_exit_fast_harness.py"
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py wait --repo "$tmp" --seconds 10 --poll-seconds 0.1
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py finalize-slice --repo "$tmp"
python3 skills/master-controller/scripts/mc.py summarize --repo "$tmp"
```

This variant still verifies the fail-closed gate behavior, but the final observation may contain only process-exited evidence if the tmux session closed before MC captured the usage-limit pane text.
